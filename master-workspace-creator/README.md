# This is the Bootstrap Job

There is a chicken and Egg problem here, we need to create the master
job, that creates all the other jobs.  But how does that job get created
(at least for the first time).  And what happens when that job modifies
itself.  Hence this workspace is cordoned off and intended to be run
manually.

There is also the question of secrets.  In this simple demo I am
assuming/showing how to manage secrets without Vault, or AWS KVM, or
Azure Key Manager, or anything

The Absoulute simplest way to put secrets into Terraform Cloud is to add
them to this master job as terraform variables. When this master job
creates child jobs it can then give them the secrets that they need.
Other methods of secret management would have each child job pull
secrets out of Vault (Etc) on each run.The secrets I am putting here are
stored in a Hashicorp Vault maintained by Hashicorp and are one way. The
normal warning about not exposing secrets in your state file
apply. Terraform cloud is based off of terraform enterprise, so the
resources are named tfe_*.
